 * Tasklet is a wrapper on top of a node so that a node can be executed based on its dependency order using the Java
 * Executor framework. When the callable returns, just getting the result as flowUnit is not sufficient, we also need
 * to know the node its coming from because the argument to the operate method is a Map of Node.Class and the flow
 * Unit. The TaskletResult is such a pair.
